# Threads of Martial Destiny
### A combat tracker for Exalted 3rd Edition.

This repo contains the source code for the [Threads of Martial Destiny web app](https://chriswellswood.github.io/martial-destiny/).   The app is meant to aid the storyteller, not to automate the process of combat, so while most of the major functionality of combat (whithering and decisive attacks _etc_) is built in, other things (like full defense) is not, but you can easily keep track of these things be directly modifying intiative. Any bug reports or feature requests are welcome, as are pull requests.
